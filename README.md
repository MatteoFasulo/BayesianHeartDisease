### Abstract

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) claims countless lives in Europe [[1]](#1), posing a massive health and economic burden. Early and accurate prediction is key to tackling this challenge, allowing for tailored prevention and intervention strategies.

Since the 1930s, research has identified diverse CVD risk factors [[2]](#2). Notably, the World Health Organization categorizes factors as modifiable (influenced by lifestyle) and non-modifiable [[3]](#3).Interestingly, modifiable factors can be significantly impacted by individual choices and interventions.

In recent years, Bayesian networks (BNs) have gained traction in healthcare, thanks to their ability to handle complex data and analyze how various risk factors interact [[4]](#4). These networks have been successfully applied to assess CVD risk, aid real-time diagnosis, and even predict hidden patient conditions.

Our work took inspiration from a paper by [Ordovas et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107405) in which the authors developed a BN to predict CVD risk. We aimed to replicate their work, using a different dataset, and to further explore the potential of BNs in CVD risk assessment. Their work helped us understand the potential of BNs in CVD risk assessment and inspired us to explore the topic further including more in depth analysis
